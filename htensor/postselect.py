"""Gauge-sector post-selection, ranked by distance from the observable.

The Z2 Gauss law gives 50 commuting stabilizers on the Ns = 50 ring,

    G_n = (-1)^n Z_n X_{L,n-1} X_{L,n},        G_n |physical> = +|physical>,

all of which are measured for free in the Z readout setting (matter in Z,
links in X).  A noisy shot that leaves the physical subspace shows up as
G_n = -1 somewhere, so the shots can be filtered on the syndrome.

Demanding all 50 checks is useless in practice: with 30k shots on
ibm_kingston the all-checks acceptance is far below the shot floor.  The
checks are therefore **ranked by distance from the observable** and only the
top-ranked ones are imposed.  For a correlator anchored at site ``center``,
the rank of check n is |n - center| on the ring, and ``window`` sets how many
ranks are kept: window = 2 imposes the five checks n = center-2 .. center+2.
This is the trade the ranking exists to make -- the errors that matter for
<J0(x) J0(center)> are the ones near its support, and each extra rank costs
shots.

Truth-independent: the criterion is the stabilizer eigenvalue, never tuned
against the classical answer.  It is also **equal-time only**.  A t > 0
circuit's syndrome is measured after the evolution, so selecting on it
post-selects the final state rather than projecting the whole trajectory;
the t = 0 slice carries no q^0 structure, so this gain does not propagate
into the assembled tensor.

A wrong logical-to-column mapping shows up here first: on the released
kingston sample the acceptance is 0.388 at window 1, and 0.072 with the
columns permuted (scripts/check_raw_pubs.py).

Canonical implementation of the logic that appears inline in
scripts/hw_w00_coarse.py:29-70 and scripts/hw_cloud_figure.py:36-61;
`tests/test_postselect.py` asserts the three agree bit for bit.
